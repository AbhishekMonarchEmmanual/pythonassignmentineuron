    "Q1. Describe three applications for exception processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Error Handling: Exception processing is commonly used for error handling in programs. When an unexpected situation or error occurs during the execution of code, an exception is raised. By catching and handling these exceptions, you can gracefully handle errors, log information about the error, and prevent the program from crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource Management: Exception processing is often used to manage resources properly, such as closing files, releasing network connections, or freeing up memory. Exceptions can be used to ensure that resources are properly released even if an error occurs during their usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input Validation: When accepting user input or processing external data, exception processing can be employed to validate the input. If the input doesn't meet certain criteria or is in an unexpected format, an exception can be raised, allowing the program to handle invalid input accordingly."

    "Q2. What happens if you don't do something extra to treat an exception?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "If you don't do something extra to treat an exception, it will result in an unhandled exception. When an exception is not caught and handled, it will propagate up the call stack until it reaches the top-level of the program, causing the program to terminate abruptly. This can lead to an error message being displayed, or in some cases, the program may crash without providing any meaningful information about the cause of the error."

    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "When an exception occurs in your script, you have several options for recovering from it:\n",
    "\n",
    "Catching and Handling Exceptions: You can use the try and except blocks to catch and handle exceptions. Inside the try block, you place the code that might raise an exception. If an exception occurs, it is caught by the corresponding except block, and you can provide specific instructions for how to handle the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally Block: You can use the finally block along with the try-except blocks. The code inside the finally block will be executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It is useful for cleanup operations like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception Logging: When catching exceptions, you can log information about the exception, including its type, message, and the context in which it occurred. This logging can help with debugging and diagnosing issues in your script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Raise Another Exception: In some cases, you may want to catch an exception and then raise another exception to indicate a different problem or add additional information about the error."
