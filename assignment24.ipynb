    "Q1. Yes, it is permissible to use several import statements to import the same module in Python. The goal could be to use different names or aliases for the module, making the code more readable or avoiding naming conflicts. For example, you can import the same module multiple times with different aliases to clearly indicate different usages of the module within the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Some characteristics of a module in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "A module is a file containing Python code and can define functions, classes, and variables.\n",
    "It provides a way to organize code into separate, reusable units.\n",
    "Modules can be imported in other Python scripts to access their defined functions and variables.\n",
    "Q3. To avoid circular importing and the resulting dependencies and bugs, you can restructure your code to separate the common functionality that causes the circular import into a third module. Then, both of the original modules can import this shared functionality from the third module. This way, the circular import is avoided, and each module can access the shared functionality without importing each other directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. In Python, the __all__ attribute is used to specify which names should be imported when using the from module import * statement. It allows module creators to control what is visible to users when they import multiple objects using the wildcard *. By specifying __all__, module creators can explicitly define the public interface of the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Referring to the __name__ attribute or the string '__main__' is useful when you want to determine if a Python script is being run as the main program or if it is being imported as a module into another script. By using the if __name__ == '__main__': construct, you can write code that should only be executed when the script is run directly, not when it is imported as a module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Attaching a program counter to the RPN interpreter application allows you to keep track of the current line or instruction being executed in the RPN script. This can be helpful for debugging and error handling, as you can identify the exact location in the script where an error occurs or where the program is currently executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. To create a basic programming language like RPN that is theoretically capable of carrying out any computerized task, you would need at least:\n",

    "Stack operations for storing and retrieving values.\n",
    "Arithmetic and logical operations for calculations and comparisons.\n",
    "Conditional statements (if, else) for decision-making.\n",

    "Input and output operations for user interaction.\n",
    "Function definition and calling for code organization and reusability.\n",
