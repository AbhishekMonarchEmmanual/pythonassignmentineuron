    "Q1. The benefits of the built-in array package:\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficient memory usage: Arrays in the array package are more memory-efficient than standard Python lists, especially for large datasets with homogeneous data types.\n",
    "Fast element-wise operations: Arrays support vectorized operations, allowing for faster mathematical computations and array manipulations.\n",
    "Integration with C code: The array package provides an interface to low-level memory buffers, making it suitable for interfacing with C code and numerical libraries.\n",
    "Q2. Limitations of the array package:\n",
    "\n",
    "Limited functionality: Compared to the more powerful numpy package, the array package has fewer features and lacks many advanced functionalities.\n",
    "Only one-dimensional arrays: The array package only supports one-dimensional arrays, which restricts its usage for multidimensional data processing.\n",
    "Q3. Main differences between the array and numpy packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Functionality: Numpy offers a much broader range of functions and capabilities for numerical computing and scientific computations compared to the basic array package.\n",
    "Multidimensional arrays: Numpy supports multidimensional arrays, while the array package is limited to one-dimensional arrays.\n",
    "Performance: Numpy is optimized for numerical computations and is generally faster than the array package.\n",
    "Q4. Distinctions between the empty, ones, and zeros functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "numpy.empty: Creates an uninitialized array with the specified shape and data type.\n",
    "numpy.ones: Creates an array filled with ones, specified by the shape and data type.\n",
    "numpy.zeros: Creates an array filled with zeros, specified by the shape and data type.\n",
    "Q5. Role of the callable argument in the fromfunction function:\n",
    "\n",
    "The callable argument in numpy.fromfunction allows you to specify a function that will be applied to each element's indices to construct a new array. The function should take the array's indices as input and return the corresponding value for each index.\n",
    "Q6. When a numpy array is combined with a single-value operand through addition (A + n), the single-value operand is broadcasted to all elements of the array, and element-wise addition is performed between each element and the single value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Array-to-scalar operations with combined operation-assign operators (e.g., += or *=) modify the original array in place. The outcome is that the combined operation is applied element-wise between the scalar and the elements of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Numpy arrays can contain fixed-length strings, specified by setting the data type (dtype) to 'S' followed by the desired string length (e.g., 'S10' for a 10-character string). If you attempt to allocate a longer string to one of these arrays, the string will be truncated to fit the specified length.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. When two numpy arrays are combined using operations like addition or multiplication, the operation is performed element-wise, meaning corresponding elements of the two arrays are combined according to the operation's rules. The conditions for combining two numpy arrays are that they must have compatible shapes or one of them must be a scalar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. The best way to use a Boolean array to mask another array is to use boolean indexing. By using a Boolean array with the same shape as the target array, you can select specific elements from the target array based on the True/False values in the Boolean array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11. Three different ways to get the standard deviation of a wide collection of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using numpy's std function: numpy.std(data)\n",
    "Using pandas library (if data is in DataFrame): data.std()\n",
    "Using standard Python (without external libraries): Calculate the mean and then calculate the sum of squared differences from the mean, divide by the number of elements, and take the square root.\n",
    "Q12. The dimensionality of a Boolean mask-generated array is the same as the original array. The Boolean mask selects specific elements from the original array, resulting in a new array with the same dimensions as the original but potentially with a different shape depending on the True/False values in the mask.\n",
