    "Answer: 1/3 (one-third) cannot be represented accurately using floating-point as it has repeating decimals. (Answer to Q8)\n",
    "Q9. Internal state of Fraction(1, 2) and Fraction(5, 10):\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: They have the same internal state (numerator = 1, denominator = 2) because both fractions represent the same value (0.5). (Answer to Q9)\n",
    "Q10. Relation between Fraction class and integer type:\n",
    "- Answer: The Fraction class does not inherit from the integer type. However, Fraction objects can represent exact integer values with a denominator of 1. (Answer to Q10)\n",
