    "A1. The purpose of Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to organize code and data into reusable, self-contained units called classes. OOP allows developers to model real-world entities, abstracting their characteristics and behaviors as objects. It provides a way to create and manage objects, enabling better code organization, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism."

    "A2. When you access an attribute (e.g., a method or a variable) on an object, Python will first look in the instance's own class. If it doesn't find the attribute there, it will proceed to search in the parent class (superclass) and continue up the class hierarchy until it either finds the attribute or raises an AttributeError if the attribute is not found in any ancestor class."

When you call a method on an instance, Python automatically passes the instance itself as the first argument (self) to the method. This allows the method to access and manipulate the instance's attributes and perform actions related to that specific instance."
