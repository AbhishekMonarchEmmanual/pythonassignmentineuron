    "Q1. What is the purpose of the try statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "The purpose of the try statement in Python is to handle exceptions and implement error handling. It allows you to write code that might raise an exception and specify how to handle the exception if it occurs. The try statement is followed by one or more except blocks that catch specific exceptions, and an optional finally block that executes cleanup code, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax of the try statement is as follows:\n",

    "Copy code\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that might raise an exception\n",

    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "The two most popular variations of the try statement are:\n",
    "\n",
    "try-except: This variation is used to catch and handle specific exceptions. The code inside the try block is executed, and if an exception of the specified type occurs, it is caught by the corresponding except block, and the specified code is executed to handle the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "try-finally: This variation is used to ensure that certain code is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. The code inside the try block is executed, and then the code inside the finally block is executed, even if an exception occurred and was not caught.\n",

    "3. What is the purpose of the raise statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "The purpose of the raise statement in Python is to explicitly raise exceptions. It allows you to raise built-in or custom exceptions at specific points in your code when certain conditions are met or errors need to be handled. The raise statement is followed by the type of exception to raise, and optionally, an error message or additional information about the exception.\n",

    "Q4. What does the assert statement do, and what other statement is it like?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "The assert statement in Python is used for debugging and testing purposes. It takes an expression as an argument and evaluates it. If the expression evaluates to False, the assert statement raises an AssertionError and stops the program's execution. It is used to check if certain conditions are true during development and to catch programming errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assert statement is similar to the if statement, but it is used for different purposes. While the if statement is used for conditional branching and general control flow, the assert statement is specifically used to check invariants during development.\n",

    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "def divide(a, b):\n",
    "    assert b != 0, \"Division by zero is not allowed.\"\n",

    "Q5. What is the purpose of the with/as argument, and what other statement is it like?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "The purpose of the with/as statement, also known as the context manager, is to simplify the management of resources, such as files or network connections, that need to be properly initialized and released. The with statement ensures that resources are acquired and released correctly, even if an exception occurs during their usage. It provides a convenient way to manage the lifecycle of resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "The with/as statement is used with objects that implement the context management protocol. The object must have __enter__() and __exit__() methods defined. The __enter__() method is executed when the block inside the with statement is entered, and the __exit__() method is executed when the block is exited, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of using the with/as statement with a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "with open(\"data.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    # Code to read and process data from the file\n",
    "# The file is automatically closed at this point\n",
    "The with/as statement is similar to the try-finally statement, where you open a resource in the try block and ensure it is closed in the finally block. However, the with/as statement is more concise and considered a more Pythonic way to manage resources."
