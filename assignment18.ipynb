    "Q1. Text files and binary files differ in how they store and interpret data. Text files use character encoding (e.g., UTF-8) to represent human-readable text, where each character is stored as a sequence of bytes. In contrast, binary files contain non-textual data, like images or executables, represented as raw sequences of bytes without character encoding. Binary files preserve the exact data, while text files may undergo newline translation on different platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Text files are better for storing human-readable data, such as text documents, configuration files, or logs. Binary files are preferred for non-textual data, like media files or data structures requiring precise byte representation, as they avoid character encoding and potential data loss or translation issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Issues with binary operations on Python integers: Different systems may use different byte orders (endianess) to represent integers, leading to incorrect interpretation. Additionally, Python integers can be arbitrarily large, requiring dynamic sizing for binary storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Benefit of using the 'with' keyword: It automatically handles the file's opening and closing, ensuring proper resource management and preventing resource leaks. It also provides a more concise and readable code structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Trailing newline when reading and writing text: Python does not include the trailing newline character ('\\n') when reading a line of text using 'readline()'. When writing text using 'write()' or 'writelines()', Python appends a newline character only if you explicitly add it to the written data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. File operations for random access: The 'seek()' and 'tell()' methods enable random-access operation, allowing you to move to specific positions within the file and determine the current position, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Usage of the struct package: The struct package is most commonly used when working with binary data or when precise control over byte order and data packing/unpacking is required, such as in networking protocols or file formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Best option for pickling: Pickling is best when you need to serialize and deserialize complex Python data structures, including custom objects, to and from a binary format. It is useful for data persistence or transferring data between different Python processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. Best usage of the shelve package: The shelve package is ideal when you need to store and retrieve Python objects in a persistent dictionary-like format. It provides a simple way to persistently store and manage data across sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. Special restriction with the shelve package: The keys used in a shelve database must be strings. If other data types are used as keys, they will be automatically converted to strings using str(), potentially leading to unintended consequences."
