    "The concept of an abstract superclass is related to object-oriented programming and inheritance. An abstract superclass, also known as an abstract class, is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It serves as a blueprint for other classes and defines a common interface that its subclasses must implement. The abstract superclass can have abstract methods, which are declared without providing an implementation in the abstract class. Subclasses that inherit from the abstract superclass are required to provide concrete implementations for these abstract methods. Abstract classes are useful for creating a hierarchy of related classes and ensuring that certain methods are available in all the subclasses.\n",

Class-level attributes are typically used for constants or variables that should be consistent for all objects of that class.\n",

    "3. A class needs to manually call a superclass's __init__ method to ensure that the initialization logic of the superclass is executed when creating an instance of the subclass. When a class is subclassed, it may inherit attributes and methods from its superclass, but the __init__ method is not automatically called for the subclass. If the superclass has some essential setup code in its __init__ method, failing to call it from the subclass can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.\n",
    "To call the superclass's __init__ method from the subclass, you use the super() function within the subclass's __init__ method. This ensures that the superclass's __init__ method is executed before any additional initialization code in the subclass. The super() function returns a proxy object that delegates method calls to the next class in the method resolution order.\n",

    "3. To augment (extend or modify) an inherited method instead of completely replacing it, you can use method overriding in object-oriented programming. Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that already exists in its superclass.\n",
