    "Q1. The two operator overloading methods that you can use in your classes to support iteration are:\n",
    "\n",
    "__iter__: This method allows an object to be an iterable. When this method is defined in a class, it should return an iterator object. The iterator object should have the __next__ method, which provides the next item in the iteration.\n",

    "__next__: This method is used to define the behavior when iterating over an object. It should return the next item in the iteration and raise the StopIteration exception when there are no more items to iterate over.\n",
