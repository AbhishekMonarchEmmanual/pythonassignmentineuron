    "Q1. To increase the comparison between different figures on the same graph, you can:\n",

    "Use different colors for each figure.\n",
    "Use different line styles (solid, dashed, dotted) for each figure.\n",
    "Use markers at data points to distinguish between figures.\n",

    "Adjust the axis limits to focus on the region of interest.\n",
    "Q2. The benefit of compound interest over a higher rate of interest that does not compound is that compound interest generates additional interest on both the principal amount and the accumulated interest. As a result, the growth of the investment accelerates over time. In contrast, with a higher rate of simple interest, the interest is only calculated on the principal amount, leading to slower overall growth.\n",

    "Dot product (numpy.dot or @): Performs matrix multiplication when dealing with 2D arrays, or inner product for 1D arrays.\n",
    "Outer product (numpy.outer): Computes the outer product of two arrays, resulting in a new array with the shape of (len(arr1), len(arr2)).\n",
    "Regular multiplication (*): Performs element-wise multiplication between two arrays of the same shape.\n",
    "Q6. Before buying a home, you can use numpy's financial functions, such as numpy.pmt(), to calculate your monthly mortgage payment based on the loan amount, interest rate, and loan term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Yes, string data can be stored in numpy arrays. However, numpy arrays have a fixed size, so all strings in the array must have the same length. If a string is assigned to a location in the array that exceeds the specified length, it will be truncated to fit the length. Additionally, numpy arrays are not as flexible for string manipulation as Python's built-in string data type."
